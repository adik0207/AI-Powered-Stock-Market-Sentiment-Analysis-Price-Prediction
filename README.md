🏆 How It Works

The LSTM model is trained using historical stock data.

Users enter key stock indicators into the Streamlit UI.

The model normalizes inputs, makes a prediction, and outputs the next day’s stock price.

📌 Example Usage

Open the Streamlit web app.

Input stock market indicators (e.g., Average Price, Trends, Momentum, etc.).

Click Predict Stock Price.

View the predicted stock price in Indian Rupees (₹).
